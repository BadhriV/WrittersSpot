            <b>Gig Economy </b><br><br>
            Gig Economy is something that has to do with the labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs. These Gig Workers may be independent contractors or freelance workers, where they may do a job for some time, and if they are not satisfied with it, they can stop it anytime they want. These workers are hired by the companies to do their jobs. There are many who are in a Gig economy. There are many freelancers who are hired by companies to finish their jobs. The main thing here is that the Sharing Economy and Gig Economy is growing at a rate that you don’t even realize that you have been hit with. Consumers are getting adapted to this, and that is why they are going to be the next big thing.
