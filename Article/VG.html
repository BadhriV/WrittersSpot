              While video gaming is gaining popularity in the entertainment industry as the best past time activity, it is also emerging as the identity of passionate and gaming. 
              With the increased usage of iPhone and easily accessible Internet, the industry of Esports has seen an upsurge in the last few years. 
              Esports are simply defined as video games that are played on a professional and competitive level among some of the professional and highly trained gamers. When video game has made its space as a professional Esport, there is still this debate whether video gaming is the same as any other sport like basketball, football, cricket among others. Video games are more than virtual gaming. Rooted in competition, involving athletic ability, requiring practice and physical activity, taking place in stadiums, and cheered on by diehard fanatics, video games and the playing of them checks all of the required boxes. 
              It is an incomplete idea that video gaming does not involve any physical exertion, mental ability, competition, and fandom. With any type of video game - but especially those with players going head to head with another player – there is a competition. Video gaming involves a lot of mental focus and responsiveness to coordinate with what is happening on the screen and what buttons to press on the remote. It also needs coordination with the teammate if it is a multi-player game. It involves physical exertion, though not as high as in basketball or football. To become a professional gamer, one must dedicate time and practice daily. However, continuous sitting on a chair for a marathon gaming session, pressing the buttons or joysticks for a long time naturally strains and fatigues the body, hence proper nutrition and hydration must also be top of mind. A gamer with a cramped hand is basically useless. If video games are not considered as a sport, based on the above-mentioned points, then what about chess and similar games? Simply, chess fails against two of the 5 points above—athletic ability and physical activity (it’s much more mental than anything, and the resulting “physical activity” is not a factor in the outcome of the match). So, are video games a sport? The answer would be a YES with uncertainty. For those of who engage with video games as a hobby, they’re fun and low key. But for the highly trained gamers and millions of viewers tuning in to watch, they’re a true sport.
